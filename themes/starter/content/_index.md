This demo shows how to use Hugo’s [Content Adapters](https://gohugo.io/content-management/content-adapters/) to build pages from remote data sources, such as JSON files and CSV data stored in a Google Sheet.

The site is built on top of Hugo’s default starter theme, which you can generate in any Hugo project by running `hugo new theme [theme-name]` from the root directory.

To understand how to work with this project, make sure you read [README.md](/).

The pages you see below are a mix of posts generated from local markdown files and dynamic remote data sources.
